# Bitcoin Ivy

Bitcoin Ivy is a higher-level language for writing smart contracts for the Bitcoin protocol. It compiles to instructions for Bitcoin’s virtual machine, Bitcoin Script, and can be used to create SegWit-compatible Bitcoin addresses. It is an adaptation of Chain’s smart contract language, [Ivy](https://chain.com/ivy).

You can try out Bitcoin Ivy using the [Bitcoin Ivy Playground](https://d2w65k0ltszbq7.cloudfront.net/bitcoin), which allows you to create test contracts and try spending them, in a sandboxed environment.

You can learn more about Bitcoin Ivy and the Bitcoin Ivy Playground by reading the [docs](https://docs.ivy-lang.com/bitcoin).

**Bitcoin Ivy is prototype software and is intended for educational purposes only**. Do not use Bitcoin Ivy or the Bitcoin Ivy playground to control real Bitcoins.
