# Example

Hereâ€™s an illustration of creating and spending the [LockWithPublicKey](/language/ExampleContracts.html#lockwithpublickey) contract in the Ivy Playground.

The example we'll be using is the LockWithPublicKey contract. The LockWithPublicKey contract works like a typical Bitcoin address. To create it, you provide a public key, and some Bitcoin. To unlock the contract, you can sign the spending transaction with the private key that corresponds to that public key.
