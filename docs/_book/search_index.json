Ivy\nBitcoin Ivy is a higher-level language for writing smart contracts for the Bitcoin protocol. It compiles to instructions for Bitcoin’s virtual machine, Bitcoin Script, and can be used to create SegWit-compatible Bitcoin addresses. It is an adaptation of Chain’s smart contract language, Ivy.\nYou can try out Bitcoin Ivy using the Bitcoin Ivy Playground [TODO: update with final URL], which allows you to create test contracts and try spending them, in a sandboxed environment.\nBitcoin Ivy is prototype software and is intended for educational purposes only. Do not use Bitcoin Ivy or the Bitcoin Ivy playground to control real Bitcoins. It does not currently support creating testnet or mainnet transactions, and if you try to use the generated scripts on the testnet or mainnet, you risk losing access to your coins. Furthermore, the playground is not built to be a secure wallet; it generates private keys and secret bytestrings using JavaScript and stores them insecurely in your browser’s local storage. Additionally, the Bitcoin Ivy compiler is relatively untested prototype software, and we make no guarantees that the scripts produced will be bug-free. \nBug reports, feature requests are welcome; you can create an issue or email ivy@chain.com [TODO: update with final email address].\n"},"playground/":{"url":"playground/","title":"Playground Documentation","keywords":"","body":"Bitcoin Ivy Playground\nThe Bitcoin Ivy Playground is a developer tool for trying out Bitcoin Ivy.

To unlock the contract, you can sign the spending transaction with the private key that corresponds to tat public key.\nTo create the contract, you provide a public key, publicKey, and fund the contract with some Bitcoins, val. The playground allows you to generate a keypair, or provide your own public or private key. (For security, do not paste your real Bitcoin private key into the playground!) The Bitcoins represented by val are locked up until the contract is spent.\nUnlocking contracts\nTo unlock value from the contract, you must call the spend clause and provide a signature, sig. In the playground, you can generate this signature by pasting in a private key. The contract then uses checkSig to confirm that sig is a valid signature on the spending transaction by the private key corresponding to publicKey. If this operation fails, the attempt to spend the contract fails as well. If it succeeds, val is unlocked.\n"},"language/":{"url":"language/","title":"Language Documentation","keywords":"","body":"Bitcoin Ivy Language\nBitcoin Ivy allows you to write contracts that secure Bitcoin using arbitrary combinations of conditions supported by Bitcoin Script.\nEach contract has one or more clauses.

Bitcoin's protocol works very differently from other blockchain protocols that support smart contracts, such as Ethereum, and the types of contracts that are supported are more limited. Despite those limitations, Bitcoin smart contracts have proven to be surprisingly flexible, supporting applications such as payment channels, cross-chain atomic trades, and more. Future protocol upgrades—and improvements in tooling—may make it possible to build increasingly sophisticated applications on top of Bitcoin.\nThe below sections provide some background on how Bitcoin transactions, addresses, and scripting work, glossing over some important details. If you would like to learn about these topics, you can check out Mastering Bitcoin, by Andreas Antonopoulos.\nThese explanations also assume that you are familiar with the basic concept of a distributed ledger, as well as digital signatures and hash functions. For more background on those concepts, you can check out this introductory post from the Chain blog.\nBitcoin contracts\nThe primary responsibility of the Bitcoin network is to maintain a distributed ledger, meaning information about who controls each of the over 16 million (at the time of this writing) Bitcoins in existence.\nYou can think of the current state of the ledger as a set of lockboxes, each of which stores some value (i.e., 1000 BTC, 5 BTC, or .001 BTC) and is controlled by some address (i.e., 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa).\nIn Bitcoin, these lockboxes are usually referred to as \"unspent transaction outputs.\" In Bitcoin Ivy, we call them contracts.\nBitcoin transactions\nEach Bitcoin transaction unlocks value from some set of contracts (or creates new value from thin air, in the case of a coinbase transaction), and locks that value into newly created contracts. The old contracts, once unlocked, are removed from the ledger state; there is no way to withdraw only part of the value from a contract, or change a contract's state. In other words, in Bitcoin, contracts are immutable.\nA transaction contains a list of inputs—the unspent contracts that the transaction wants to unlock—and a list of outputs—the new contracts that the contract wants to create. The amount of value unlocked in the inputs must be equal to the amount of value locked in the outputs.\nFor more on Bitcoin transactions, you can check out Chapter 6 of Mastering Bitcoin, Transactions.\nBitcoin addresses\nBitcoin wouldn't provide much security if anyone were able to unlock any contract. Contracts can only be unlocked under certain conditions, specified in that contract's address. For example, an address can specify that the contract can only be unlocked using a digital signature from the contract's owner (or more specifically, by the private key corresponding to a prespecified public key).\nEach Bitcoin address corresponds to a program.1 When you send Bitcoin to an address, you are creating a contract which locks that Bitcoin up with that address's program. The only way to spend that Bitcoin is to satisfy the program, thus unlocking the value and allowing it to be sent to a new address. \nWhen spending a contract, the user provides some arguments to satisfy the contract's program. For example, the arguments might include one or more signatures, or the preimage of a particular hash. In Bitcoin Ivy, these arguments are referred to as clause arguments, since they are provided at the time that a particular clause of the contract is invoked.\nBitcoin Script\nBitcoin Script is the low-level language that contracts' programs are written in. It consists of a sequence of opcodes, which are executed in order by a stack-based virtual machine (after the provided clause arguments are first placed on the stack).\nBitcoin Script is a relatively simple language, with support for cryptographic and hash operations, as well as conditionals. It is not Turing-complete (since it has no support for looping or recursion). It also does not allow scripts to inspect other inputs or outputs in the transaction, meaning the contract cannot control the flow of value or maintain any kind of persistent state.2\nDevelopers already use Bitcoin Script to create multisignature Bitcoin addresses and time-locked transactions, as well as more complex protocols like payment channels and cross-chain atomic trades. But reading and writing programs using Bitcoin Script is difficult, as is using it to create addresses and transactions. The goal of Bitcoin Ivy is to make it easier to write and instantiate these programs.\nFor more on Bitcoin Script, you can check out the Bitcoin Wiki as well as Chapter 7 of Mastering Bitcoin, Advanced Transactions and Scripting\n\n1. Conversion between Bitcoin Script programs and Bitcoin addresses involves some technical details that are beyond the scope of this documentation. The Bitcoin Ivy compiler creates Segregated Witness (SegWit) addresses, a new kind of Bitcoin address that has been supported since a protocol upgrade in August 2017. To create a SegWit address, the bytecode of the program—the \"witness script\"—is hashed to create a \"redeem script,\" which is in turn hashed to create the address. To spend from a SegWit address, both the redeem script and the witness script are revealed, and arguments are provided to satisfy the witness script. For more on how SegWit addresses and scripts work, see the Segregated Witness Wallet Development Guide from Bitcoin Core. ↩\n\n\n2. The inability to directly control value is a major difference between Bitcoin Ivy and the version of Ivy used to write smart contracts for Chain Core. There have been several proposals to add this kind of functionality to Bitcoin Script, most notably in Bitcoin Covenants, by Malte Möser, Ittay Eyal, and Emin Gün Sirer. ↩\n\n"},"language/Types.html":{"url":"language/Types.html","title":"Types","keywords":"","body":"Types\n\nBytes: a string of bytes (typically represented in hexadecimal)\n\nPublicKey: an ECDSA public key\n\nSignature: a ECDSA signature by some private key on the hash of the transaction\n\nTime: a time (either a block height or a timestamp)\n\nDuration: a duration (either a number of blocks or a multiple of 512 seconds)\n\nBoolean: either true or false\n\nValue: Some amount of Bitcoins (or, more precisely, some amount of satoshis).

You can try out these contracts in the playground, where they are preloaded as default templates.\n\nLockWithPublicKey\nLockWithMultiSig\nLockWithPublicKeyHash\nRevealPreimage\nRevealCollision\nLockUntil\nLockDelay\nTransferWithTimeout\nEscrowWithTimeout\nVaultSpend\n\nLockWithPublicKey\ncontract LockWithPublicKey(publicKey: PublicKey, val: Value) {\n  clause spend(sig: Signature) {\n    verify checkSig(publicKey, sig)\n    unlock val\n  }\n}\nLockWithPublicKey creates a simple Bitcoin address. A public key is specified at the time the contract is created. To spend from the contract, the user must provide a signature on the spending transaction from that public key.\nAll addresses produced by the Bitcoin Ivy compiler are SegWit addresses. However, unlike the other contracts, which compile to Pay-To-Witness-Script-Hash addresses, LockWithPublicKey compiles to a Pay-To-Witness-Public-Key-Hash address, a special (slightly more efficient) format for addresses that are controlled by a single public key.\nLockWithMultiSig\ncontract LockWithMultisig(\n  pubKey1: PublicKey,\n  pubKey2: PublicKey,\n  pubKey3: PublicKey,\n  val: Value\n) {\n  clause spend(sig1: Signature, sig2: Signature) {\n    verify checkMultiSig([pubKey1, pubKey2, pubKey3], [sig1, sig2])\n    unlock val\n  }\n}\nLockWithMultiSig creates a multisig address. Three public keys are specified at the time the contract is created. To spend from the contract, the user must provide signatures on the spending transaction from two of the three public keys.\nLockWithPublicKeyHash\ncontract LockWithPublicKeyHash(pubKeyHash: Sha256(PublicKey), val: Value) {\n  clause spend(pubKey: PublicKey, sig: Signature) {\n    verify sha256(pubKey) == pubKeyHash\n    verify checkSig(pubKey, sig)\n    unlock val\n  }\n}\nLockWithPublicKeyHash is similar to the LockWithPublicKey contract, except instead of taking a public key as a contract argument, it takes the SHA256 hash of that public key. Then, when it is spent, it expects an additional argument, the public key. The public key is hashed and compared to the pubKeyHash contract argument before the signature is checked.\nThere is not much reason to use this contract, particularly since modern Bitcoin addresses only reveal a hash of their script anyway, so their contract arguments are never explicitly revealed. Indeed, the publicKey argument to the LockWithPublicKey contract is hashed four times before it included in the generated address.\nRevealPreimage\ncontract RevealPreimage(hash: Sha256(Bytes), val: Value) {\n  clause reveal(string: Bytes) {\n    verify sha256(string) == hash\n    unlock val\n  }\n}\nRevealPreimage can be unlocked by providing the preimage for a prespecified SHA256 hash digest.\nThis contract is typically not useful, since unlike a signature, a hash preimage is not tied to a specific spending transaction. If you tried to spend this contract by revealing the preimage, there would be nothing to stop a miner who saw your transaction from replacing it with a transaction that uses that preimage to unlock the contract and spend it to themselves.\nRevealCollision\ncontract RevealCollision(val: Value) {\n  clause reveal(string1: Bytes, string2: Bytes) {\n    verify string1 != string2\n    verify sha1(string1) == sha1(string2)\n    unlock val\n  }\n}\nRevealCollision pays a reward to anyone who provides a SHA1 collision—two different bytestrings whose SHA1 hashes are equal.\nPeter Todd used this script to post a bounty on collisions for several hash functions. When a SHA1 collision was found in February 2017, someone used that collision to claim the bounty.\nAs with the RevealPreimage contract, any attempt to spend this contract could potentially be sniped by miners.\nLockUntil\ncontract LockUntil(publicKey: PublicKey, time: Time, val: Value) {\n  clause spend(sig: Signature) {\n    verify checkSig(publicKey, sig)\n    verify after(time)\n    unlock val\n  }\n}\nLockUntil is similar to LockWithPublicKey, but adds an additional condition known as a timelock—it can only be spent after a particular time has passed.\nAbsolute timelocks (which use the nLockTime field of the spending transaction and the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY opcode) can be used to prevent yourself from withdrawing Bitcoin before a certain time. They are also useful for some more sophisticated applications, such as escrow or payment channels.\nLockDelay\ncontract LockDelay(publicKey: PublicKey, delay: Duration, val: Value) {\n  clause spend(sig: Signature) {\n    verify checkSig(publicKey, sig)\n    verify older(delay)\n    unlock val\n  }\n}\nLockDelay is similar to LockUntil, but instead of an absolute timelock, it uses a relative timelock—it can only be spent a certain amount of time after the contract has been added to the blockchain.\nRelative timelocks (which use the transaction input's sequence number CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY opcode) can be more convenient than absolute locktimes, but they can also enable some powerful additional features in protocols such as payment channels.\nTransferWithTimeout\ncontract TransferWithTimeout(\n  sender: PublicKey,\n  recipient: PublicKey,\n  timeout: Time,\n  val: Value\n) {\n  clause transfer(senderSig: Signature, recipientSig: Signature) {\n    verify checkSig(sender, senderSig)\n    verify checkSig(recipient, recipientSig)\n    unlock val\n  }\n  clause timeout(senderSig: Signature) {\n    verify checkSig(sender, senderSig)\n    verify after(timeout)\n    unlock val\n  }\n}\nTransferWithTimeout is our first example that has more than one clause. To satisfy such a contract, you only need to satisfy one of the clauses.\nThis contract is instantiated with two public keys, corresponding to the \"sender\" and the \"recipient\" of some transfer. The contract can be spent by the mutual agreement of both parties.\nThis contract could be used to create a primitive one-way payment channel. Suppose Alice wants to make a series of micropayments to Bob (for example, because she is browsing a publication owned by Bob, or watching a movie that she is paying for by the minute), but doesn't want to pay a transaction fee for every one of them.\nAlice can prefund this TransferWithTimeOut contract with 10 BTC, using her own public key as the sender and Bob's key as the recipient. She can then create a transaction that sends some small portion of the contract—say, .00001 BTC—to Bob, but sends the rest back to herself. She signs that transaction and sends it to Bob (but doesn't send it to the blockchain). Bob only needs to add his signature to claim his .00001 BTC, but he can also wait for further payments. \nAlice can then send additional micropayments on this channel by creating new transactions that spend the same contract but send increasing amounts to Bob. Whenever Bob wants to close the channel, he signs and publishes only the last of those transactions, which sends Alice's total payment to him and returns the remaining change to her.\nWhat happens if Bob disappears, or refuses to sign any transactions? That's what the timeout clause is for. After the channel's expiration time, Alice can call the timeout clause to reclaim all of the Bitcoin she used to prefund the channel. This prevents Alice's money from being locked up forever if Bob refuses to cooperate.\nEscrowWithTimeout\ncontract EscrowWithTimeout(\n  sender: PublicKey,\n  recipient: PublicKey,\n  escrow: PublicKey,\n  timeout: Time,\n  val: Value\n) {\n  clause transfer(escrowSig: Signature, recipientSig: Signature) {\n    verify checkSig(escrow, escrowSig)\n    verify checkSig(recipient, recipientSig)\n    unlock val\n  }\n  clause timeout(senderSig: Signature) {\n    verify checkSig(sender, senderSig)\n    verify after(timeout)\n    unlock val\n  }\n}\nEscrowWithTimeout implements a simple escrow contract. When it is instantiated, three keys are specified—one for the sender of the transfer, one for the recipient, and one for an escrow agent.\nThe escrow agent can approve the transfer with the cooperation of the recipient, but cannot steal the money for himself.\nIf the escrow agent fails to cooperate, then after the expiration time, the sender is able to cancel the transfer and recover the money with the timeout clause.\nYou can imagine variants of this contract that, for example give the recipient the funds in the event of a timeout instead of the sender, or that allow the sender and escrow agent, or the sender and recipient, to unlock the funds by mutual agreement.\nVaultSpend\ncontract VaultSpend(\n  hotKey: PublicKey,\n  coldKey: PublicKey,\n  delay: Duration,\n  val: Value\n) {\n  clause cancel(sig: Signature) {\n    verify checkSig(coldKey, sig)\n    unlock val\n  }\n  clause complete(sig: Signature) {\n    verify older(delay)\n    verify checkSig(hotKey, sig)\n    unlock val\n  }\n}\nVaultSpend implements a simple form of vault, a mechanism for securing Bitcoin held in cold storage.\nThis contract is instantiated with two public keys: a hotKey and a coldKey. The \"hot key\" could be kept on a computer or server; the \"cold key\"—or \"cancellation key\"—would be kept somewhere offline and hard to get to, such as a paper wallet in a safety deposit box.\nYou would not actually store your funds in this contract. Instead, you could hold funds in a LockWithPublicKey contract secured by coldKey, and then presign a transaction that spends it into this contract. You could keep the presigned transaction on the same server as the hot key. \nTo withdraw the funds, you could use the presigned transaction to move them into this contract. After the delay has passed, you could then use the hot key to move the funds wherever you want to send them.\nIf an attacker compromises your server and steals the presigned transaction and hot key, they would only be able to move the money into this contract. The time delay would then give you enough time to notice, retrieve your cold key, and move the money to a safer contract.\nThe initial design for vaults by Möser, Eyal, and Sirer depended on a feature, covenants, that is not yet supported in Bitcoin Script. The implementation of vaults described above makes use of only existing Bitcoin Script features, but has some key limitations. Most importantly, an attacker who surreptitiously steals the hot key could wait for the owner to attempt a hot-key withdrawal, then, after the delay has expired, spend the transaction before the owner is able to. Until Bitcoin adds support for covenants (if ever), it may not be possible to fully implement a vault.\n"},"js/":{"url":"js/","title":"JavaScript SDK","keywords":"","body":"JavaScript SDK\nBitcoin Ivy is also available as a (very unstable and early-stage) JavaScript SDK.\nnpm install bitcoin-ivy\nThis library allows you to write and compile contract templates, instantiate them with arguments (to create Bitcoin addresses), create dummy contracts (with fake value), and unlock them with arguments. \nIt does not support creating real transactions (on either the testnet or mainnet).
